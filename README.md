## Features
- Parses and processes job descriptions to extract important details.
- Utilizes NLP techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and named entity recognition (NER).
- Implements machine learning models to classify and structure extracted data.
- Enhances recruitment efficiency by providing structured job attributes.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NLP (Natural Language Processing)
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- Transformers
- NumPy
- PyPDF2
- Pandas
